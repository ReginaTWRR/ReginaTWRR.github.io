                <p>Philosophy is the rational, abstract, and methodical study of reality as a whole
                    or of the fundamental dimensions of human existence and experience. It comes
                    from the Greek word philosophia, which is translated through Latin to "love of
                    wisdom". A major component of the intellectual histories of many civilisations
                    is philosophical investigation. <sup>[1]</sup>
                </p>
                <p>Philosophy is founded by people who overthink. People who refuse to settle for
                    the easy explanation. People who insist on complicating everything beyond
                    reason. The fact is that overthinking can sometimes produce some pretty
                    remarkable ideas about the world. There is this view that our existence as
                    humans is just a way for the universe to experience itself. I think that's
                    beautiful. I suppose you could say then that we were always meant to ask these
                    questions.

                    <p>One of the three greatest thinkers in the history of Western philosophy,
                        together with Plato and Aristotle, Socrates was an ancient Greek
                        philosopher who lived in Athens in the fifth century BCE. He was revered by
                        his followers for his honesty, self-mastery, deep philosophical
                        understanding, and formidable argumentative skill. He was the first Greek
                        philosopher to explore ethical issues seriously. He had such a profound
                        impact on the subsequent development of ancient philosophy that the
                        philosophers who came before him are now known as the "pre-Socratics". <sup>[2]</sup>

                    <p>What precisely does the examination of life entail? For Socrates, it
                        involved challenging the meaning of fundamental ideas that we employ on a
                        daily basis but have never given much attention to, thereboy exposing their
                        true significance and our knowledge or ignorance. According to his beliefs,
                        virtue is "the most valuable of possessions" and nobody genuinely wants to
                        do evil. Anyone who commits evil acts would be acting against their
                        conscience and would feel uneasy as a result. As we all want to be at peace
                        with ourselves, we would not voluntarily perform evil actions. He believed
                        that evil was committed due to ignorance and a lack of wisdom. From this he
                        concluded that "there is only one good: knowledge; and one evil:
                        ignorance." <sup>[1]</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>The effect of Socrates' philosophy is something that is felt virtually
                        everywhere in the modern world, yet very few people seem to realise it. I
                        think this is really ironic because the crux of his beliefs was to question
                        everything. Knowledge can never be taken for granted. Socrates was truly a
                        thinker way beyond his time, and it is really worth examining why his works
                        remain relevant to this day.

                    <p>René Descartes was a French mathematician, scientist, and philosopher who
                        was born in La Haye, Touraine, on March 31, 1596. He is widely recognised
                        as the founder of modern philosophy because he developed the first modern
                        version of mind-body dualism and encouraged the development of a new
                        science based on experimentation and observation. He rejected apparent
                        knowledge from authority, the senses, and reason by applying a unique
                        system of methodical doubt. He established new epistemological foundations
                        based on the intuition that he exists when he is thinking, which he
                        articulated in the dictum "I think, therefore I am". He created a
                        metaphysical dualism that makes a sharp distinction between mind, the
                        essence of which is thinking, and matter, the essence of which is extension
                        in three dimensions. <sup>[3]</sup>

                    <p>Descartes employs what is referred to as "the method of doubt" to
                        demonstrate the stability and endurance of his ideas, which he considers to
                        be two crucial indicators of knowledge. Descartes' goal is to demonstrate
                        that knowledge may be attained even if we begin with the most skeptical
                        position possible, doubting everything. <sup>[1]</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>In case it wasn't clear, René Descartes revolutionised epistemology. His
                        approach to proving existence follows a very clear mathematical structure.
                        As if solving an equation, Descartes begins by declaring a singular
                        powerful "axiom": "I think therefore I am". His highly systematic manner of
                        building up a philosophical foundation from scratch completely blows my
                        mind. He even invented the Cartesian coordinate system! I think René
                        Descartes is the coolest philosopher.

                    <p>Above is a picture of the 19th century German philosopher,
                        Friedrich Nietzsche, as well as a quote which in my opinion sums up his
                        overall ideology perfectly.
                    </p>
                    <p>Friedrich Nietzsche was born in Röcken, Saxony, Prussia (Germany) on October
                        15, 1844. He was a German classical scholar, philosopher, and cultural
                        critic who rose to prominence among modern thinkers. Generations of
                        theologians, philosophers, psychologists, poets, novelists, and playwrights
                        were greatly impacted by his efforts to expose the motivations underlying
                        conventional Western religion, morality, and philosophy. Despite his strong
                        opposition to nationalisatiom, antisemitism, and power politics, fascists
                        eventually used his name to further the very causes he detested. <sup>[4]</sup>

                    <p>Nietzsche refers to this "revaluation of all values" as one of the main
                        goals of his philosophy, which aims to challenge all of the ways we are
                        used to thinking about ethics and the meanings and purposes of life.
                        Nietzsche asserts repeatedly that in doing so, he is laying out a
                        philosophy of cheerfulness that seeks to affirm life even it if contradicts
                        all we have previously believed about good and evil. According to him, a
                        lot of the things we consider "good" are actually means of limiting or
                        turning away from life. <sup>[1]</sup></p>
                    <p>Friedrich Nietzsche is my favourite philosopher. I think he has a really
                        compelling way of expressing his ideology. The emotional effect he achieves
                        through his writings is so profound, I really wonder what it's like in his
                        shoes. He is a very misunderstood guy. I'm absolutely fascinated by
                        Nietzsche and the impact he has left on philosophy.

                    </figure>
                    <p>Epistemology is defined as the philosophical study of the nature, sources,
                        and boundaries of human knowledge. The field is sometimes called the theory
                        of knowledge, as its name is derived from the Greek epistēmē, which means
                        "knowledge," and logos, which means "reason." <sup>[1]</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>Aristotle once said that philosophy begins in a kind of wonder or
                        puzzlement. Like the majority of people, epistemologists frequently start
                        their speculations by assuming they know a lot. However, as they consider
                        what they presumably know, they find that it is far less secure than they
                        initially believed, and they even start to think that many of their firmest
                        views are questionable or even untrue. <sup>[1]</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>Epistemology is thus an attempt to reconcile the differences between what we
                        think we know and what we actually know. I personally like to think of it
                        as the study of how perception and reality affect each other. In this
                        context it may be instinctive to ask, what is reality? What is knowledge?
                        How can anyone truly know anything? In my experience the fun only starts
                        after you get over this initial existential crisis.

                    <p>Ethics is defined as the study of what is ethically right and wrong, as well
                        as good and evil. Any philosophy or system of moral ideals or principles
                        can also be referred to by this name. <sup>[2]</sup> In other words ethics
                        is about what we as humans owe to each other. Living an ethical life means
                        being aware of your moral duties as a person and acting in ways that are
                        considerate to other people, because the very nature of being a human means
                        you are not in this life or world alone.
                    </p>
                    <p>The main concerns of ethics are the nature of ultimate value and the
                        criteria by which human activities can be deemed right or wrong. Its
                        subject consists of the fundamental problems of practical decision making. <sup>[2]</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>Ethics is the philosophical field with the most contributors. In other words
                        it gets the most attention out of all the main branches of philosophy. And
                        rightfully so, because ethics literally dictates how each person should
                        live. What does it mean to live an ethical life? What are the duties and
                        obligations we must fulfill as citizens of a society? Is it even possible
                        to live ethically in today's world? Perhaps the first step of living
                        ethically is to bother asking these questions in the first place.
                    </p>
                    <h4>Normative ethics</h4>
                    <p>Normative ethics is the area of ethics that deals with standards of what is
                        morally right and wrong. It involves the creation of moral principles that
                        have direct implications for human behaviour, institutions, and ways of
                        life. <sup>[3]</sup>

                        <summary>Consequentialism</summary>
                        <p>Consequentialism, also called teleological ethics, is a doctrine that
                            actions should be assessed according to their consequences in order to
                            determine their morality. Classical utilitarianism is the most basic type
                            of consequentialism. It holds that an action is morally correct or
                            incorrect based on whether it optimises the universe's net balance of
                            pleasure over pain. <sup>[4]</sup>

                        <summary>Deontology</summary>
                        <p>In philosophy, deontological ethics refers to ethical views that
                            emphasise the relationship between the morality of human actions and
                            duty. The word deontology is rooted in the Greek words deon, which
                            means "duty", and logos, which means "science". According to
                            deontological ethics, an action is morally good due to some aspect of
                            the action itself, rather than because the product of the action is
                            good. It holds that certain actions are morally obligatory regardless
                            of how they may affect the welfare of people. <sup>[5]</sup></p>

                        <summary>Virtue ethics</summary>
                        <p>Virtue ethics is a method of approaching ethics that considers virtue -
                            often thought of as excellence - to be essential. Character traits that
                            are vital to human flourishing are the main focus of virtue ethics. It
                            somewhat deviates from the conventional division between
                            consequentialism and deontological ethics. While it agrees with
                            consequentialism that an action's morality is determined by how it
                            relates to an end that has inherent value, it more closely resembles
                            deontological ethics in that morally right actions are part of the end
                            itself rather than merely serving as a mean to an end. <sup>[6]</sup>
                        </p>
                        <p>Aristotle believed that there were certain virtues of mind and
                            character, like courage or generosity, and you should try to develop
                            yourself in accordance with those virtues. <sup>[7]</sup> Virtue ethics
                            is the school of thought that I personally follow. To me being a
                            follower of virtue ethics means that you have a moral obligation to
                            constantly improve yourself to the best of your ability. In other words
                            self-improvement isn't just for the sake of yourself, it's also for the
                            sake of the people around you. The first step of accomplishing this is
                            gaining more knowledge about yourself, and then asking questions about
                            how you can work on your virtues. Hence virtue ethics is a
                            philosophical model that affirms Socrates' belief that knowledge is
                            bound to morality.

                    <p>I think it is becoming increasingly more difficult to live ethically in our
                        world. There seem to be too many distractions and malignant factors keeping
                        us from behaving in ways that exhibit our truly compassionate and
                        empathetic selves. Paradoxically having access to every kind of information
                        all the time has led us to become less knowledgeable, less skeptical, and
                        less willing to be ourselves. But as individuals we simply have to try. As
                        humans we owe it to each other to live ethically.

                    <h4>Metaethics</h4>
                    <p>Metaethics is the area of ethics that studies the nature, basis, and scope
                        of moral judgments, ideas, and values. It is more concerned with what it
                        means for an action to be right and if moral judgments are objective and
                        can be true at all than it is with which actions are right. It also looks
                        at what morality and other moral terms mean. By examining the underlying
                        presumptions of normative ethics, metaethics is a metatheory that functions
                        at a higher degree of abstraction than normative ethics. Generally
                        speaking, normative ethical theories are not directly evaluated by
                        metaethical theories. Metaethical theories can nevertheless have an impact
                        on normative theories by analysing their foundational principles. <sup>[8]</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>The ontological status of morality and the veracity of ethical ideals and
                        principles are major debates in metaethics. It investigates whether moral
                        qualities exist as objective characteristics separate from the human mind
                        and culture instead of being subjective constructs or manifestations of
                        cultural norms and personal preferences. <sup>[8]</sup>

                        <summary>Moral realism</summary>
                        <p>According to moral realists, statements about what actions are morally
                            necessary or acceptable, as well as what dispositions or character
                            traits are morally virtuous or vicious (and so forth), are not merely
                            subjective preferences. Rather, they are objectively true or false
                            based on how well they match the facts of morality, just as historical
                            or geographic statements are true or false based on how well they fit
                            the historical or geographic facts. <sup>[9]</sup>

                        <summary>Moral relativism</summary>
                        <p>Moral relativism is the idea that there are no unchanging moral
                            principles and that morality differs from person to person or from
                            society to society. <sup>[10]</sup> According to some moral
                            relativists, moral systems are designed to achieve specific objectives,
                            such as social coordination. This perspective holds that various
                            cultures and social groupings within a society develop distinct moral
                            systems in accordance with their disparate goals. <sup>[8]</sup>

                        <summary>Moral nihilism</summary>
                        <p>Moral nihilists deny the existence of moral facts. Both the subjective
                            moral facts supported by moral relativism and the objective moral facts
                            supported by moral realism are denied by them. They think that the
                            fundamental presumptions that underlie moral claims are incorrect. This
                            leads some moral nihilists to believe that anything is acceptable. A
                            slightly different perspective highlights that moral nihilism is not
                            itself a moral stance about what is permitted and what is not but the
                            rejection of all moral positions. <sup>[8]</sup>
                        </p>
                    </details>
                    <p>I struggle to decide on which of these three schools of thought resonates
                        most with me. All of them seem too extreme to genuinely believe in. I can
                        say that I lean most towards moral relativism, though the view that there
                        are absolutely no unchanging moral principles seems off. A moral statement
                        like "Slavery is wrong" is very clearly true to me. Hence I think I sit
                        somewhere between moral relativism and moral realism. I believe that
                        morality is mostly subjective but there are still absolute moral truths.

                    <h3>What is the trolley problem?</h3>
                    <p>The trolley problem is a thought experiment first introduced by British
                        philosopher Philippa Foot in 1967.
                    </p>
                    <p>You are driving a trolley when the brakes fail. On the track ahead of you
                        are five workmen you will run over. You can steer to another track, but on
                        that track is one person you'd kill instead of the five. What do you do? <sup>[1]</sup>

                    <p>Approximately 90% of respondents to surveys on the trolley problem have
                        opted to kill the one and save the five. Respondents are far less likely to
                        be willing to sacrifice one life if the scenario is modified where the one
                        sacrificed for the five was a relative or romantic partner. <sup>[2]</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>The trolley problem is important because it has been used to explore the
                        applicability and validity of the doctrine of double effect and the
                        difference between causing harm and permitting harm. It has also been used
                        to make clear the shortcomings of consequentialist (e.g. utilitarian) and
                        deontological (rule-based) approaches in applied ethics. <sup>[3]</sup>
                    </p>
                    <p>I would personally steer the trolley onto the other track and choose to kill
                        the one person as well, assuming everyone involved were strangers.
                        If the one person was someone I knew and the other five were strangers, I
                        would most likely freeze and watch the trolley ram into five
                        innocent people. This is in essence just a would-you-rather question but
                        its implications are so dynamic.
                    </p>
                    <p>I think the trolley problem emphasises how people subconsciously have
                        personal biases whenever they make decisions. To most people choosing to
                        kill one over five is the obvious answer. However very interestingly when
                        the context changes we get radically diverse responses to the problem.
                        Let's explore some variations of the trolley problem!

                    <h3>What are some variations of the trolley problem?</h3>
                    <details>
                        <summary>The Fat Man</summary>
                        <p>A trolley is speeding down a track toward five individuals just as it was
                            before. By placing something really heavy in front of it, you can block it
                            from passing beneath the bridge you are on. The only way to stop the
                            trolley is to push the overweight man next to you over the bridge and onto
                            the track, killing him to save the five. Should you proceed? <sup>[2]</sup>
                        </p>
                        <p>When asked, most people choose not to kill the fat man in order to save the
                            five people. As a result, efforts have been made to identify a meaningful
                            moral difference between the fat man and the original trolley problem. One
                            distinction might be that in the first instance, hurting the one is merely
                            a consequence of moving the cart away from the five, and no damage is
                            intended towards anyone. In the second instance, however, hurting the one
                            is a necessary part of the plan to save the five. In essence, this solution
                            applies the doctrine of double effect, which states that while one may act
                            in a way that has negative consequences, it is unethical to intentionally
                            inflict harm, even for good reasons. Therefore in the original trolley
                            problem, as long as it is not intentional, killing one over five is
                            acceptable even if the harm to the innocent person was anticipated. <sup>[2]</sup>
                        </p>
                    </details>
                    <details>
                        <summary>The Fat Villain</summary>
                        <p>This variation is similar to The Fat Man, with the added claim that the
                            fat man who might be pushed is a villain who is accountable for the
                            entire circumstance: the fat man was the one who tied five people to
                            the track and aimed a trolley toward them with the goal of killing
                            them. Most individuals are willing to push the fat man in this
                            variation. Pushing the fat villain to stop the trolley, in contrast to
                            the last scenario, could be interpreted as a form of self-defense or
                            retributive justice. <sup>[2]</sup>

                    <details>
                        <summary>The Transplant Problem</summary>
                        <p>You're a doctor and you can save five patients. The catch is that you
                            have to kill one healthy person and use his organs to do it. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The transplant problem is very relevant and known in applied ethics,
                            particularly in medical ethics. The Hippocratic oath that doctors take
                            forbids them from doing harm. Although five people will die, doctors
                            generally agree that they cannot harm one innocent person to save them
                            and thus forsake their oath.
                        </p>
                        <p>In American philosopher Judith Jarvis Thomson's "Killing, Letting Die,
                            and the Trolley Problem", she posits a question: "Why is it that Edward
                            may turn that trolley to save his five, but David may not cut up his
                            healthy specimen to save his five?" To answer this question it has been
                            proposed that there is a morally decisive difference between the two
                            cases. While Edward would <strong>unavoidably</strong> violate the one
                            person's right to control what is done to his own body if he redirected
                            the trolley, the surgeon would <strong>avoidably</strong> violate the
                            donor's corresponding right to control what is done to his own body if
                            he removed the donor's organs. <sup>[4]</sup>
                        </p>
                    </details>
                    <p>As you can see, many philosophers have modified and used the trolley problem
                        as arguments for their respective theses since it entered philosophy almost
                        60 years ago. The trolley problem is just one of many many thought
                        experiments in ethics which serves as a way for us to investigate our own
                        moral impulses. Personally, the trolley problem is a reminder that in
                        philosophy there is no right answer. In life too there isn't an answer for
                        everything, but the mystery is part of the fun. The appeal of philosophy is
                        to indulge in introspection. In the words of Socrates, "I know nothing
                        except the fact of my ignorance".
